# 🧰 Dev Tools for Developers

Welcome to **Dev Tools** — a growing collection of reusable utilities, scripts, and packages to make your development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

## 📂 Structure

All tools are organized in folders based on their purpose or framework:

```
/composables           → Vue.js composables
/pint-rules            → Laravel Pint (code style) custom rules
```

- More coming soon...

### 🧼 Laravel Pint Rules

- Based on Laravel preset, enhanced with real-world best practices

### 🛠 Developer Helpers
